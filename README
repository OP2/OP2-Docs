This is the documentation of the OP2 project [1].

To build it you need sphinx [2] (tested with version 1.0.7) and make:
Run
  * `make html` to build the html docs
  * `make latexpdf` to build the PDF manual
  * `make publish` to build both and publish in ~/public_html/op2
  * `make publish PUBLISHDIR=<dir>` to build both and publish in <dir>
